A set of webpages developed in HTML,CSS and Javascript to send data(commands) to
a web server.



If running locally, open the index.html site. Ensure internet connectivity as
you are sending data to an internet server ;)

Enter the device name on the first page you see. The device name can only
contain numbers and alphabets now. No spaces.

Once the device name is correctly entered, you will now see a direction pad.
Press the appropriate button to send the command.
